FSF is a plug-in based freakin' simple fuzzer for fuzzing **web applications** and **scraping data**.

## Platform ##
  * Windows(_[.NET Framework 3.5](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=333325FD-AE52-4E35-B531-508D977D32A6&displaylang=en)_)
  * OSX (_[Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page)_).
  * Linux (_[Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page)_).

## Quick Info ##
It supports some basic stuff and missing some features however it has got some advanced RegEx capturing features for scraping data out of web applications.

It's still in early stage of development. It's not well tested and I developed it when I need it, so don't keep your hopes high.

Although you are always welcome to do feature requests and report some bugs.


## Why bring yet another fuzzer into this cruel world? ##
Yeah, I know there are so many of them hanging around. Basically I was trying to fuzz something and after spending about 2-3 hours about 3-4 different terribly designed fuzzers I thought knocking up mine would be better.

No offence to other fuzzers and by no means I claim that this fuzzer design is user-friendly or so much better than others. It's more like I designed it so I know _my own shit_ sort of usable.

## Don't use if you.... ##
  * want a fuzzer where you can control the raw HTTP request
  * need some crazy features such as fuzzing multiple locations at a time (_actually latest version support fuzzing 2 points simultaneously, still that's the limit_)


## Use if you need a fuzzer... ##
  * that allows to take advantage of RegEx with the full power for scraping data _(this is quite useful while exploiting SQL Injections, gathering data, looking for some hidden resource or trying to enumerate all valid "user id"s_)
  * easy to run
  * that makes it easy to write your own fuzzing modules
  * with a simple and compact .NET code
